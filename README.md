# monday-dot-com

npm install 

Need to create a .env file that contains the Monday dot com secret.Â 

Secrets can be generated within Monday.com with an account. Easy to Find.

All api calls print to the console for now. These can easily be changed to return the data. 

Call function at the bottom of the file then run node monday-test.js
